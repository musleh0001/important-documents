#### What is Data Structures?

Data Structures are different ways of organizing data on your computer, that can be used effectively.

#### 

#### What is Algorithm?

Set of rules for a computer program to accomplish a task.

#### 

#### Types of Data Structures

1. Data Structures
   
   1.1 Primitive
   
       1.1.1 Integer
   
       1.1.2 Float
   
       1.1.3 Character
   
       1.1.4 String
   
       1.1.5 Boolean
   
   1.2 Non Primitive
   
       1.2.1 Linear
   
           1.2.1.1 Static
   
               1.2.1.1.1 Array
   
           1.2.1.2 Dynamic
   
               1.2.1.2.1 Linked List
   
               1.2.1.2.2 Stack
   
               1.2.1.2.3 Queue
   
       1.2.2 Non Linear
   
           1.2.2.1 Tree
   
           1.2.2.2 Graph

#### Types of Algorithms

1. Simple recursive

2. Divide and conquer

3. Dynamic programming

4. Greedy

5. Brute force

6. Randomized

#### 

#### Recursion

A way of solving problem by having a function calling itself.

###### Step

1. Performing the same operation multiple times with inputs

2. In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller

3. Base condition is needed to stop the recursion, otherwise infinite loop will occur



#### When to Use/Avoid Recursion?

###### When to use it:

1. When we can easily breakdown a problem into similar subproblem.

2. When we are fine with extra overhead (both time and space) that comes with it.

3. When we need a quick working solution instead of efficient one

4. When traverse a tree

5. When we use memoization in recursion

###### When avoid it:

1. If time and space complexity matters for us.

2. Recursion can be slow.
